                    Recording and production work on the debut album took place at Mosfilm Moscow until 10 May 1999,
                    when the debut was finally released. The promotion of Zemfira prior to the release included heavy
                    rotation of singles "AIDS" (СПИД), "Arrivederci" (Aриведерчи), and "Rockets" (Ракеты) as well as
                    the video clips for those songs. The band immediately went on tour, starting a tradition of
                    celebrating their beginnings with a summer concert in Ufa while recording their second album
                    Forgive Me My Love (Прости Меня Моя Любовь). The group enjoyed popularity from the start, in part
                    because of heavy rotation on radio and television, and in part because a female rocker is a fairly
                    rare and unusual concept for the Russian music scene (which to this day is dominated by
                    scantily-clad female pop singers).
                    After the release of PMML (Russian abbreviation for Forgive Me My Love) in March 2000, what can
                    only be described as “Zemfiromania” swept the country. "Searching" (Искала) and "Ripe" (Созрела)
                    became instant hits, and the group was invited to headline the festival Maxidrom. Constant touring
                    wore down on the band, and after the release of 14 Weeks of Silence the band took a break.
                    In September 2004, Zemfira began studies towards a degree in Philosophy at Moscow State University,
                    but after the first semester she took a sabbatical and did not resume her studies thereafter. On 16
                    October on the MTV Russia Awards show the singer performed "We Are the Champions" together with the
                    rock group Queen.
                    The fourth studio album, Vendetta, which consists of 15 tracks, was released on 1 March 2005. The
                    recording became a result of Zemfira's collaboration with several musicians: Igor Vdovin, Korney,
                    Vlad Kreymer, Yuri Tsaler and Oleg Pungin. Primarily the album was going to be named "Oil", but the
                    title was changed few days before the official release. "Vendetta" got many positive reviews,

                    On 14 February, a collection of music videos Zemfira.DVD was released. It contains all singer's
                    clips, except AIDS and Traffic'.'
                    n May and June 2007, Zemfira embarked on a short concert tour titled 'Déjà Vu', with performances
                    held in smaller venues (clubs and small theatres). The tour culminated with a Moscow performance at
                    the Green Theatre which was filmed by Renata Litvinova. The tour program focused on stylish remakes
                    of the singer's top hits, often reworked is styles such as jazz, ska, bossa nova, and blues. A new
                    album, Thank You (Спасибо), was released at the beginning of October. It is described by Zemfira
                    herself as 'very positive', in contrast to what she terms the 'restlessness' of Vendetta.
                    The concert movie Green Theatre in Zemfira, which mixes Zemfira's monologues with selected songs
                    shot during her live performance at the open air show in Moscow, was released in several Russian
                    digital movie theatres on February 21, 2008. Later it was also released on DVD and Blu-ray.
                    The final concert in support of Thank You was staged on 1 April 2008 at the Olimpiysky stadium in
                    Moscow; some journalists considered it as the best performance in her career. Later in June Zemfira
                    was awarded an independent Steppenwolf prize established by a musical critic Artemy Troitsky. She
                    won in two categories: The Best Performance (for the Olimpiysky show) and The Best Album (Thank
                    You). The movie-concert Green Theatre in Zemfira by Litvinova was named the best musical movie of
                    the year.
                    On 21 March 2009, an album of b-sides Z-Sides leaked into the net.
                    In June 2010, Zemfira wrote on her official website: "vacation is over" and announced a mini-tour
                    in support of a deluxe-edition of her first three albums (Zemfira, PMML and 14 Weeks of Silence).
                    On August 1 she performed a set of 4 songs on the closing concert of a pop-music contest New Wave.
                    It was her first performance since January 2009. The arrangements of this set were used in the
                    mini-tour in September that included 5 cities: Saint-Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Minsk, Kiev and
                    Moscow. Critics admitted that her old songs became more rhythmic and resembled demo-versions due to
                    the new minimalistic style of arrangements. In October Zemfira took part in two tribute concerts
                    "20 Years without KINO" in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg that were dedicated to the memory of Viktor
                    Tsoi. Her gig of four covers on Tsoi's songs was seen by some journalists as the most noticeable
                    performance in the program.
                    On New Year's Eve 2011, the video version of two Moscow concerts staged in Crocus City Hall and
                    Strelka Institute in September 2010 was broadcast on Dozhd' (Rain) TV channel. The video was
                    directed by Renata Litvinova. Then the singer informed her fans that the release of her sixth album
                    had moved to the fall 2011. The first single No Chance (Bez shansov) was presented on Nashe Radio
                    on 15 April. During the next three months she gave three performances: on May 28 Zemfira took part
                    in the international rock festival Maxidrom along with The Prodigy, Adam Lambert, Korn, Brainstorm
                    and other artists; then she became a Russian headliner of a Muz-TV Awards ceremony show at
                    Olimpiysky stadium on 3 June; on July 23 Zemfira performed at the Afisha Picnic outdoor festival in
                    Moscow as the Russian headliner of the main stage. During that gig she presented a new song called
                    "Money". At her April 2013 concert in Kiev, she was joined by several leading figures of Ukrainian
                    showbusiness on stage, including Svyatoslav Vakarchuk. She offended some audience members by
                    comparing Kiev to Moscow, in that she had to work hard, rather than Odessa and St Petersburg where
                    the crowd do the work.
                    In July 2015, Zemfira unfurled Ukraine's national flag at a concert in the Georgian capital of
                    Tbilisi, drawing criticism from Russian media, while several promoters in Russia abandoned their
                    plans to include her in their programs. However, in 2016, in a concert in Lithuania, Zemfira
                    demanded the audience to remove a huge Ukrainian flag that was unfolded by fans. She said, "I'm
                    Russian, we're in Lithuania. I'm asking you, get rid of that flag. Whilst you love your country, I
                    love mine."
                    In February 2016 during her "Little Man" (Маленький человек) tour Zemfira announced that she would
                    stop touring, which was misrepresented in the media as her abandoning musical performance
                    altogether. Musical critic Troitsky commented that while he does not doubt that the announcement
                    was made in earnest, he believed that since Zemfira is an emotional person, she may change her
                    decision later. As of November 2016 the "Little Man" tour continues in North America.</p>

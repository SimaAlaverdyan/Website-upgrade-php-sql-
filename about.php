            <p class="bioText">An ethnic Volga Tatar, she was born in a typical middle-class family – her mother is a
                doctor, and her father a history teacher. At the age of 4, Zemfira became interested in music, entering
                a music school the following year (where she studied piano performance and voice) and writing her first
                song when she was seven years old. Her older brother Ramil introduced her to rock music, which became
                her real passion – she listened to Black Sabbath, Nazareth and Queen, learning to play the guitar. In
                the 7th grade, Zemfira split her time between music and basketball, becoming the captain of the Russian
                Girls’ Junior Basketball Team by 1990. She began to lose interest in classical music, preferring
                instead to hang out with friends in the streets of Ufa and covering songs by Russian rock groups such
                as Kino, Nautilus Pompilius and Aquarium (who reached the peak of their popularity in the early 1990s).
                At the urging of her mother, Zemfira continued with piano studies and graduated music school with
                honors. In her last year of high school, basketball competed with school work, and the singer abandoned
                the sport in favour of music. She took the entrance exams for the Ufa College of Fine Arts and was
                admitted into the second year, studying vocal performance. During college, she performed jazz and rock
                and roll standards in various local bars and restaurants accompanied by her friend, saxophone player
                Vlad Kolchin. She graduated with honors, and in 1996 took a job as a sound engineer at the Ufa
                subsidiary of the radio station "Europe Plus".
                For the next couple of years Zemfira spent her days making advertisement recordings at the station and
                her nights on a computer, where she recorded the songs that would later become the singles "Why"
                (Почему), "Snow" (Снег), and "Weatherman" (Синоптик). In early 1998, Zemfira invited Rinat Akhmadiyev,
                Sergei Sozinov, Sergei Mirolyubov, and Vadim Solovyov to join Zemfira. Their first professional gig
                took place on 19 June 1999 as part of a festival celebrating the anniversary of a local radio station
                Silver Rain Ufa. Shortly after Zemfira sent out promo tapes to multiple Moscow producers, one of whom
                (Ilya Lagutenko from Mumiy Troll) was smitten with the material, and invited the band for some sessions
                in Moscow.
